## Explanation
The repetition of symbols means we probably have some sort of encoding.
We have two leads from the desc/title: Ascalon and Magdaer.
Searching these gets us some stuff about Guild Wars 2.
Then searching Guild Wars 2 language gets us https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Languages_of_Tyria.
If we ook through list at bottom and see which ones match, we find https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/New_Krytan.
