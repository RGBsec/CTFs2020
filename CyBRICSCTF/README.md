# CyBRICS Lite 2020

This was a very hard CTF, and to make it worse about half our team wasn't available.
We finished #111, with 452 points.

We solved:
* Mic Check
* Broken Invitation
* Keyshooter
* Krevedka
* Hellish Reverse
* Baby Rev
* Polyglot
* Hunt
* Gif2png

Right now Keyshooter, Baby Rev, Krevedka and Polyglot have writeups. More will come later.
