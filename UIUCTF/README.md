## Reflection
by qpwoeirut

I only solved 2 challenges in this CTF, but thanks to my teammates we finished 19th.

From a crypto perspective, I wish there were more crypto challenges.
I was able to solve everything except nookcrypt, and I'm fine with that since I still don't really understand ECC.

I spent a lot of this CTF trying other categories.
I reminded myself that I'm completely inept at pwn and failed to solve the pwn warmup challenge.

I also really enjoyed Omega Stonks, and I think that was a great challenge idea.
In practice, betting payouts should probably have been higher.
The botting probably would have happened no matter what, since you still need capital to start betting.

Overall a great and well-run CTF.
