# Files from CTFs in 2020
by qpwoeirut

Most of these directories are a complete mess of solutions, challenge files, and failed solutions.
The only ones that are organized and have writeups are:
* redpwnCTF
* Chujowy CTF
* UIUCTF
* CSICTF
* CyBRICS Lite 2020
* InCTF 2020

For organized directories, all challenges should be in their own folders.
If a challenge is not in `unsolved` or `solved_by_teammates` then it should have a writeup in the README.
Every organized directory will also have a README.

Also, a lot of the solver scripts will use a library called `utils`.
This is a mashup of random python scripts that I found useful for CTFs.
It's not public because I'm very very mean.
But everything in there should be self explanatory anyway, so it shouldn't be hard to write yourself.
