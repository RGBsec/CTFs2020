# Chujowy CTF

This was a very difficult CTF - our team wasn't able to clear all the "beginner" challenges.

I solved 4 challenges this CTF:
* Insanity 1
* Grownup RSA
* Robots
* Deployment

Both Robots and Deployment are very easy web challenges, so their writeups are combined into one document under `web`.
