## Explanation
The was a `#bot-spam` channel on the server, and of course people were spamming it as always.
But this time I noticed that `.flag` wasn't posted, and Kuwu was sending a lot of `Ssssshhhh, not here. DM me maybe ;)`.
So I DM'd Kuwu with `.flag` and got the flag.

`csictf{m0r3_huMaN_than_Y0u}`

In hindsight the `.flag` is rather obvious since Discord bots respond to messages with a certain prefix and Kuwu was responding to things like `.8ball` and `.list`.
