> The flag.zip contains the flag I am looking for but it is password protected. The password is the encrypted message which has to be correctly decrypted so I can use it to open the zip file. I tried using RSA but the zip doesn't open by it. Can you help me get the flag please? 

Files: flag.zip, a.txt
