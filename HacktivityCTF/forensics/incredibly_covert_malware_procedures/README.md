I have no idea about ICMP but we can see that each ICMP packet seems to have part of an image, repeated a few times.
We can just find which offsets work so that we get each part exactly once.
Then put together the image parts to get the flag.

Implementation at `solve_icmp.py`

`flag{not_so_stealthy_exfil}`
