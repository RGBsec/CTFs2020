# DMOJCTF 2020
by qpwoeirut

This folder holds all the work that I (qpwoeirut) did for [DMOJ CTF 2020](https://dmoj.ca/contest/ectf20).
Since the author has posted editorials for the challenges, there aren't any polished writeups in here.

There may be some quick solution sketches which should hopefully be enough to understand the solution.

## Notes and Thoughts
I actually managed to solve a pwn challenge in this CTF, even though it was just integer overflow.

I enjoyed the CTF, and I think that it deserves to have a larger audience.
Since it was hosted on DMOJ, which mainly focuses on competitive programming, there weren't many participants.
Although I did get to find out that Andrew He is also apparently very good at CTFs, so that was interesting.

I ended up stopping after the first 2 days but still managed to place 17th out of 115 active users.
